## Files to turn in
`ft_strcpy.c`

---

## Allowed functions
`None`

---

- Reproduce the behavior of the function `strcpy` (man strcpy)
- for loop is forbidden, so use while loop instead
- variable declaration and its value assigning should be done on separate line (like

```c
int i = 0;
```

  should be modified to be like

```c
int i;

i = 0;
```
  )
- Here's how it should be prototyped:

```c
	char	*ft_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
```
