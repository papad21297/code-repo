## Files to turn in
`ft_sort_int_tab.c`

---

## Allowed functions
`None`

---

- Create a function which sorts an array of integers by ascending order.
- The arguments are a pointer to int and the number of ints in the array.
- for loop is forbidden, so use while loop instead
- variable declaration and its value assigning should be done on separate line (like

```c
int i = 0;
```

  should be modified to be like

```c
int i;

i = 0;
```
  )
- Here's how it should be prototyped:

```c
	void	ft_sort_int_tab(int *tab, int size);
```
